## RANS flamelet/progress variable solver for OpenFOAM

## Description

This solver is part of my research work on reactive flows and LES in 2005-2010. It is based on the work by [Charles Pierce (2001)](https://web.stanford.edu/group/ctr/pdf/charles_pierce_thesis.pdf).

### Requirements

The library was developed for [OpenFOAM 1.7.x](https://github.com/OpenCFD/OpenFOAM-1.7.x). Modifications for OpenFOAM 2.x and newer version required since the structure of thermodynamics library was changed.
